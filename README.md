# Proteomics Cell Type Enrichment Analysis (PCTSEA)

This tool has been designed to be a cell type enrichment tool for proteomics quantitative data.   
It compares publicly available RNAseq single cell datasets with the input protein list and performs an enrichment analysis based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics to end up determining the set of cell types that are significantly enriched in the input data.   
   
### Availability of the software:
PCTSEA server can be found at http://pctsea.scripps.edu   
PCTSEA is also available as a command line at http://sealion.scripps.edu/pCtSEA/
